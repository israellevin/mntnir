mountaineer: two men skilled in climbing mountains
mntnir: the CLI volume manager

This small bash script lets you mount, unmount and detach volumes right from the comfort of your command line, while adhering to the freedesktop standards. It is an easy interface to the udisks daemon, which handles the mounting of volumes in most modern linux systems.

Run the script with no arguments to see an informative list of volumes attached to your machine:
    $ ./mntnir.sh
    /dev/sdd1 : libcard 16GB not mounted
    /dev/sda1 : Tardis 500GB not mounted
    /dev/sda2 : loserfs 32kB not mounted
    /dev/sdc1 : 400GB mounted on /
    /dev/sdb1 : Tera 1TB mounted on /media/Tera

Run it with a single argument to filter the list according to substring:
    $ ./mntnir.sh sda
    /dev/sda1 : Tardis 500GB not mounted
    /dev/sda2 : loserfs 32kB not mounted

If the filter comes up with a single result, it prints possible actions:
    $ ./mntnir.sh libca
    /dev/sdd1 mount
    /dev/sdd1 detach

Give it a letter or more from the start of your chosen action to make it so:
    $ ./mntnir.sh libca m
    /dev/sdd1 mounted on /media/libcard

Or glue it all together in a script with something like dmenu:
    #!/bin/sh
    dmenu='dmenu -i -l 10'
    vol=`mntnir.sh | $dmenu`
    if [ "$vol" ]; then
        command=`mntnir.sh $vol | $dmenu`
        if [ "$command" ]; then
            mntnir.sh $command | $dmenu
        fi
    fi
